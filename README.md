# Mister-CPS-maps
Arcade stick mappings for tournament play of Mister FPGA cps cores


The aim of these files are to provide Mister users with arcade stick map files in order to streamline the mappingprocess at tournaments.    
putting these files in an empty /media/fat/config/inputs/ folder should result in any supported stick to work for any cps/cps2 6 button game to be mapped correctly.
